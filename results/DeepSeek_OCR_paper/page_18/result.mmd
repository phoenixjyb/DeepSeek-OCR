<center>Figure 12 | We retain DeepSeek-OCR's capabilities in general visual understanding, mainly including image description, object detection, grounding, etc. Meanwhile, due to the inclusion of text-only data, DeepSeek-OCR's language capabilities are also retained. Note that since we do not include SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) stage, the model is not a chatbot, and some capabilities need completion prompts to be activated. </center>  


## 5. Discussion  


Our work represents an initial exploration into the boundaries of vision-text compression, investigating how many vision tokens are required to decode \(N\) text tokens. The preliminary results are encouraging: DeepSeek- OCR achieves near- lossless OCR compression at approximately \(10 \times\) ratios, while \(20 \times\) compression still retains \(60 \%\) accuracy. These findings suggest promising directions for future applications, such as implementing optical processing for dialogue histories beyond \(k\) rounds in multi- turn conversations to achieve \(10 \times\) compression efficiency.
